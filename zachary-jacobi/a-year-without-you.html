              You died a year ago.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wish I had more to show for it. "It" being both the last twelve
              months and your death.
            </p>
            <p>
              I hate how <em>small</em> you are now, how your actions are so
              circumscribed, a few not-yet-stale links that someone might follow
              to your writing, a few monthly donations in your name, a few
              inherited books not yet opened, and all our ever-fading memories.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wish I could have prevented that. There are stories of enormous,
              inspiring, heroic grief. I got the tattoo you'd wanted, the
              Kirkegaard quote—<em>but by virtue of the fact that they began</em
              >—with the faint hope that your sudden ending could be a virtuous
              beginning for me.
            </p>
            <p>
              But your existence was far more inspiring than your death. You
              don’t live on as an advisory angel on my shoulder, nor as anguish
              I can burn to fuel a pursuit of a better world. I do not think
              “<em>I should do what Zach would do</em>” or “<em
                >I should be someone Zach would be proud of</em
              >” nearly so often as I think “<em
                >I wish I could ask Zach about this</em
              >”. You are missing from the world, and I cannot seem to make you
              larger or more real.
            </p>
            <p>
              Is this a standard stage of grief? Kübler-Ross is dead, too, but
              her collaborator wrote a book claiming that the sixth stage of
              grief is finding meaning. I have not reached that stage. Your
              death was pointless. An accident that underscored how fragile
              bodies are. It is so obvious that the world would be better (<em
                >that I would be better</em
              >) if you hadn’t died. You can see why I might struggle to find
              meaning, there.
            </p>
            <p>
              I haven’t read all of your blog posts, yet. There were many I
              skimmed when you first put them online, since we’d already
              rehearsed all your points over our phone calls. When I look back
              at your archive, I’m struck by how many new ideas you were
              generating, even during your most unmotivated months. I do not
              think I am being unfair when I say that most people lack your
              level of intellectual vitality. I might read a book or a blog
              post, and regurgitate a few borrowed notions, but I rarely think,
              deeply, for myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              You might have argued against that self-judgment but, darling, I
              used to think <em>for you</em>. I don’t think either of us
              realized how much.
            </p>
            <p>
              I broke down over your bookshelf last summer, when I was clearing
              out your apartment with your parents. It was
              <em>A Monetary History of the United States</em> that did it, I
              think. One of the early graphs in the book had moved you to tears.
              You told me about it over the phone, how it charted US money
              supply versus GDP, and the relationship between the money supply
              and the recessions of the past century was so elegant, so
              sublimely true, that you could not help but cry. I sat on your
              bedroom floor, and flipped through the book’s pages, and squinted
              at the figures, and couldn’t figure out which one you’d found so
              beautiful. I started to cry, not because I appreciated the
              scholarship, because it became clear to me how little I was
              interested in the book now that I couldn’t discuss it with you.
            </p>
            <p>
              You apologized to me, more than once, for having become boring in
              your burnout. I see the lying inadequacy of my reassurances, now.
              I said I loved you, and loved talking with you, but I said it with
              a despicable patience in my voice. As if I trusted that you’d
              someday regain your former vitality, and I wanted you to believe I
              would wait. I wish I could show us how boring I have become, now
              that I no longer need to keep pace with you. A month can pass
              without a single insight.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m not lonely. I want to make that clear. I have wonderful people
              in my life, people who are clever and kind, people that I love,
              and sometimes we are talking, I am walking beside them down a side
              street, or lying on their bed looking up at their ceiling, and we
              are tossing new ideas back and forth, and I am fully engaged, and
              it’s so good. But, Zach, we used to do that every day. I remember.
            </p>
            <p>
              I try to make some of the same corrections I would have expected
              you to make. I nudge my opinions towards freedom of speech and
              Arendtian intolerance. I know it’s inadequate. Your values were
              not fixed, and my decaying, static model of you is ever more out
              of date. The world is changing, and you cannot.
            </p>
            <p>
              For my birthday, I asked people to send me stories about you. My
              favourites were the ones from after I’d moved away. I got a
              glimpse of how you looked to the friends who met you after you’d
              learned the shape of your anxieties, and embraced your
              extroversion, and realized how infectious your enthusiasm and your
              empathy could be. You’d grown into yourself so much. I wanted to
              follow that story to its ending. But lives aren’t stories. You
              weren’t <em>done</em>, obviously, but you can’t do anything more.
              I hate that the search results for your name are crowded with
              lurid reports of an accident. A meaningless ending.
            </p>
            <p>
              I love you. I wish I had more to show for it. I wish there were
              more of you left in the world to love. I am so grateful, and so
              sorry, and I miss you.
            </p>
