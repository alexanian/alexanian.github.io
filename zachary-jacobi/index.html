                Zachary Jacobi was my favourite person in the world from sometime in early 2015 until the day they died. Remembering how excellent Zach was is a very poor substitute for having them in my life, but it’s the best I’ve got.

            <h2>Writing about Zach</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="/zachary-jacobi/a-year-without-you.html">A year without you</a>: what I wrote for the first anniversary of Zach’s death. “I love you. I wish I had more to show for it. I wish there were more of you left in the world to love.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="/zachary-jacobi/eulogy">Eulogy</a>: what I said at Zach's funeral on August 16, 2019. "I hope that each of you, at some point in your life, gets an opportunity to experience something like what Zach and I had."
                    
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://alertlabs.com/pages/zachary-jacobi">Alert Labs memorial page</a>: a page created by Zach’s friends and colleagues 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Zach's writing</h2>
            <p>
                Zach wrote over a million words in the time they were alive, many of them on their blog, Socratic Form Microscopy. In retrospect, it’s kind of ridiculous how many ideas they were generating every week. The website is down right now, so you’re sadly missing out on those ideas, but I’m working on getting it back up and will update this page once I have.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can find a few other traces of Zach on the internet, if you’re curious. They wrote around <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/46626554-zachary-jacobi?sort=review&view=reviews">100 reviews on Goodreads</a>, though the <a href="https://tessa.fyi/socratic-form-microscopy/tag/book-review">Book Review tag</a> on their blog will be much more substantial. Zach collected some <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/list/46626554">quotes</a> there as well. Zach had taken the <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/">Giving What We Can</a> pledge, and there is an <a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com/Fundraiser.aspx?FundraiserID=8259">Against Malaria Foundation</a> fundraiser in their name.
