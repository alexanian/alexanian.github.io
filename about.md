I swore an oath upon honor and cold iron before departing <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">Waterloo</a>,
Ontario to become an engineer at <a href="https://zymergen.com/">Zymergen</a> in Emeryville, California,
where I spent four years attempting to persuade robots to do biology experiments. I realized I was spending
an awful lot of my spare time reading papers about biosecurity, so now I'm working on preventing pandemics,
most recently as part of iGEM's <a href="https://responsibility.igem.org">Safety and Security Program</a>.

### Professional bio

Tessa Alexanian is trying to steer towards nice futures for biotechnology. After finishing her engineering degree, she spent four years wrangling robots to do biological engineering at Zymergen, followed by two years serving as the iGEM Competitionâ€™s Safety and Security officer. Her work has focused on modular laboratory automation, developing cultures of responsibility in the life sciences, and assessing dual-use risks from synthetic biology. Tessa has run workshops on Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) verification, responsible use of synthetic biology beyond containment, and collaborative biosecurity. She holds a 2023 CSR Fellowship for Ending Bioweapons, and was a 2022 ELBI fellow, a 2020 Foresight Fellow, and a 2017 iGEM BWC delegate.
