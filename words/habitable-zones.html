            <h2>I. The Moon Trees</h2>
            <p>If you were going to the moon, and you could fill one small bag with anything you wanted, what would you bring?</p>
            <p>Stuart Roosa brought seeds.</p>
            <p>Every Apollo astronaut was allotted space for a Personal Preference Kit. One man on the Apollo 14 mission packed golf balls. There&rsquo;s a video of him swinging a makeshift club on the lunar surface. Stuart Roosa didn&rsquo;t go to the surface. He was alone, suspended in the sky, orbiting the moon in the mission&rsquo;s Command Module, accompanied by his hundreds of personal tree seeds.</p>
            <p>The seeds&mdash;sycamore, sweet gum, loblolly pine, douglas fir, and redwood&mdash;had been selected by the U.S. Forest Service. Back in 1953, Roosa had served with them as a smokejumper, parachuting down into wildfires to protect the old growth. The seeds were partly a tribute to the Forest Service, partly an experiment. He wasn&rsquo;t sure they would survive more than a week of weightlessness.</p>
            <p>The seeds came back to earth. Nearly all of them survived. Nearly all of them have been lost.</p>
            <p>In 1996, a NASA archivist received a letter from some children who asked why a sycamore near their school had a little sign reading &ldquo;moon tree&rdquo;. It had been two years since Stuart Roosa died, and memory is fragile. The archivist had never heard of such a thing.</p>
            <p>He unearthed faded newspaper clippings&mdash;&ldquo;Moon Tree Planted!&rdquo;&mdash;and began a search for the rest of Stuart Roosa&rsquo;s seeds. The Forest Service had sent seedlings to public squares and universities and girl scout camps, but they kept no official records. There were hundreds of seedlings, but the archivist found only eighty trees.</p>
            <p>The others will be hard to find. The Forest Service planted a few moon trees alongside controls of the same species, and they couldn&rsquo;t see any difference in how they grew. I only learned of them because one was planted in a botanic garden near my home. Every plant specimen in the garden has a little sign, perhaps ten centimeters by twenty, embossed with letters spelling out the name of the plant and the location where the garden&rsquo;s specimen originated:</p>
            <p><em>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi. Somoa Dunes, Humboldt County.</em></p>
            <p><em>Marah horridus. Along Tollhouse Road, Fresno County.</em></p>
            <p>There is no special plaque to draw attention to the redwood that went to the moon. It sits in a grove with many other stately, ruddy-barked trees. But a friend pointed to its little sign, which you have to bend down to read:</p>
            <p><em>Sequoia sempervirens (&ldquo;moon tree&rdquo;). The seed from which this tree sprang was taken to the moon.</em></p>
            <p>That species name, <em>sempervirens</em>, means <em>everlasting</em>. Redwoods are not, of course, but they seem so when compared with the brief time a person can spend on earth. The redwoods that sprouted when Leonardo da Vinci was born still haven&rsquo;t reached the average lifespan of a <em>sempervirens</em>. The oldest redwoods in California were growing while Emperor Nero watched Rome burn.</p>
            <p>It has been nearly 50 years since the end of the Apollo program, and half of its astronauts have died. The youngest of them is 83 years old. There may come a time when a few anonymous redwoods are the only living things that have been to the moon.</p>
            <p>There are plans, or at least ambitions, to send people back to lunar orbit by 2023. I find it comforting that, even if such plans go awry, the moon trees will carry on growing. I&rsquo;m grateful that a spacefarer chose to fill his small bag with seeds and planted trees whose shade has outlasted him.</p>

            <h2>II. Atomic Gardens</h2>
            <p>The first seeds to return from space were sent there on a missile.</p>
            <p>Researchers weren&rsquo;t sure they would survive exposure to cosmic radiation in the thin upper atmosphere. Ionizing radiation is a hazard to every creature with DNA. It snaps our phosphate backbones, and hasty genetic repairs can leave behind mutations at the joints. Most of these have no effect, but some mutations propagate through cellular generations and make us sick.</p>
            <p>Something mutated in the hearts of the Apollo astronauts. Most solar winds and cosmic rays are deflected by the earth&rsquo;s magnetosphere, which extends several planet-lengths out into space. The Apollo astronauts passed beyond that protection, and 43% of them came home and died of heart disease. Compare their deaths against only 9% of the astronauts who never flew.</p>
            <p>How exposed were they? Stuart Roosa and the other Apollo 14 astronauts experienced a 0.0114 Sv dose of radiation. We didn&rsquo;t need to send anyone to space to guess at the hazards of such a dose. We know it increased cancer by 44% among survivors of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>
            <p>A third of the civilians in those cities died. Less than a year after the bombings, the U.S. military launched seeds into space on a repurposed Nazi missile. The seeds survived. Plants can, in general, live through much more radiation than people.</p>
            <p>You can find many examples of such stubborn survival. Blades of grass rising from cracks in the sidewalk concrete. Birch trees growing on gray rooftops in the exclusion zone around Chernobyl. In John Hersey&rsquo;s 1946 book <em>Hiroshima</em>, he describes the floral aftermath of destruction: &ldquo;over everything&mdash;up through the wreckage of the city, in gutters, along the riverbanks, tangled among tiles and tin roofing, climbing on charred tree trunks&mdash;was a blanket of fresh, vivid, lush, optimistic green; the verdancy rose even from the foundations of ruined houses. Weeds already hid the ashes, and wild flowers were in bloom among the city&rsquo;s bones.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>There is something beautiful about a garden returning after an armageddon. It&rsquo;s an old, familiar myth. But the bones of that city were calcium as well as steel. The weeds were hiding human ashes.</p>
            <p>The U.S. government built gardens as part of the 1950s <em>Atoms for Peace</em> program. The circular fields of these &ldquo;gamma gardens&rdquo; were centered around barrels full of radioactive cobalt, with the aim of stimulating appetizing mutations in the irradiated plants. When Eisenhower launched <em>Atoms for Peace</em> with a speech at the United Nations, he said the U.S. would &ldquo;devote its entire heart and mind to finding the way by which the miraculous inventiveness of man shall not be dedicated to his death, but consecrated to his life&rdquo;.</p>
            <p>Less than a year after that speech, the U.S. military tested the first modern thermonuclear weapon at Bikini Atoll. A city would need a miracle of invention to survive such a bomb. One profane possibility was proposed in 2017 by the designer Cole Jorissen. His Whole Earth Biotechnology Laboratories, a speculative &ldquo;biological solution to the nuclear threat&rdquo;, borrows not from plant biology, but from the tardigrade, perhaps the most famously radiation-resistant organism on earth.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Tardigrades, more affectionately called water bears, are eight-legged swimmers less than half a millimeter long. They live on mountaintops and in the deep sea, in Antarctica and the Amazon. A radiation dose of 5 Sv can be fatal to a human; a dose of 50 to most trees; a tardigrade can live through 5,000. An explanation for this was uncovered in 2016, when scientists saw that tardigrades have a unique damage-suppressing protein, <em>DSup</em>, that binds around their DNA and shields its backbone.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This protein is imagined as a biological solution to the nuclear threat, gene drives full of <em>DSup </em>forming a &ldquo;nuclear vaccine&rdquo; that spreads radiation resistance to rice fields and fish farms in the wake of another atomic bombing. The designer doesn&rsquo;t mention the lives or biology of the people who, surely, must also be a part of the solution, but <em>DSup </em>has been shown to protect human cells against radiation.</p>
            <p>Perhaps our future astronauts will be the first to test a radiological vaccine. If we are going to space, humanity will need to find new ways to live with radiation. It seems the small and sessile organisms of our home planet seem to have a lot to teach us about how to resist radiation, and how to survive it. I hope we keep our rockets pointed away from the planet, so that their earthbound habitats remain hospitable long enough for us to learn from them.</p>

            <p><strong>III. Life Support</strong></p>
            <p>In the final episode of <em>Cosmos</em>, Carl Sagan describes one of his bad dreams. He&rsquo;s watching a blue-green planet spin sedately along its orbit, when suddenly it goes dark. Radio and television broadcasts, rushing past him at the speed of light, cut to silence. He doesn&rsquo;t know what catastrophe is responsible&mdash;climate change, plague, nuclear war?&mdash;but whichever it was, it has ended our story. The episode is called <em>Who Speaks for Earth?</em></p>
            <p>One of my favourite quotes from Cosmos tempers Sagan&rsquo;s hope with his fear: <em>if we do not destroy ourselves, I believe we will someday venture to the stars</em>.</p>
            <p>Cherokee, the language from which <em>sequoia sempervirens</em> takes the first part of its botanical name, distinguishes between the inclusive and exclusive &ldquo;we&rdquo;. I wonder who is included in the &ldquo;we&rdquo; who will someday venture to the stars. I know that Sagan meant for all of humanity to be included, but I wonder what other life from our pale blue dot will join us out there. <em>Who speaks for the trees?</em></p>
            <p>To someday venture to the stars, a living thing must first must venture into the future. There are so many extinctions.</p>
            <p>Scientific resurrection is still a very speculative way to consecrate such lives. In 2003, the Pyreanean ibex became the first creature brought back from extinction. Seven minutes later, it became the first creature to go extinct twice. The ibex was genetically identical to the frozen tissue from which it had been cloned, but, unlike its progenitor, was born with lung defects. A DNA sequence alone could not bring the ibex back. If our only basis for resurrection is decontextualized genomes, then let us not overpromise.</p>
            <p>I know that, at least at first, it will be a very exclusive &ldquo;we&rdquo; who can leave the planet. Sending humanity into space requires sectioning off a little pocket of air and moisture, a tiny capsule of artificial Earth, or at least of the parts of its environment most essential for our survival. This is delicate, expensive work. Space will be limited. We will have to travel light.</p>
            <p>But the environment essential for our survival has never been a purely human one. Our spacefarers will carry seeds, and I hope they carry lessons from Earth&rsquo;s other organisms. I hope we leave room in our visions for a more inclusive &ldquo;we&rdquo;.</p>
            <p>If you imagine a spaceship travelling to Mars, please do not picture it as a waiting room. The most minimal life support system does not <em>look</em> minimalist. There will be no smooth white walls and softly blinking blue lights. The interior of the International Space Station is a mess of tubes and wires and velcro. If we are speculating, why not choose a fecund science fiction? Why imagine sitting in a sterile tin can, when you could imagine the chirping of cricket farms and the gurgling of hydroponics?</p>
            <p>In fact, if you&rsquo;re looking for a vision of terrestrial life venturing to the stars, perhaps you could picture a terrarium.</p>
