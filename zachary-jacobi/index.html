                Zachary Jacobi was my favourite person in the world from sometime in early 2015 until the day they died. Remembering how excellent Zach was is a very poor substitute for having them in my life, but it’s the best I’ve got.

            <h2>Writing about Zach</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="/zachary-jacobi/eulogy">Eulogy</a>: what I said at Zach's funeral on August 16, 2019. <em>“I hope that each of you, at some point in your life, gets an opportunity to experience something like what Zach and I had.”</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="/zachary-jacobi/a-year-without-you.html">A year without you</a>: what I wrote for the first anniversary of Zach’s death. <em>“I love you. I wish I had more to show for it. I wish there were more of you left in the world to love.”</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="/zachary-jacobi/elephant-aversary.html">Elephant-aversary</a>: an annual tradition of putting elephants in strange places, which celebrates the most metaphorically resonant moment of my life with Zach.
          </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://alertlabs.com/pages/zachary-jacobi">Alert Labs memorial page</a>: a page created by Zach’s friends and colleagues 
            </p>
            <h2>Zach's writing</h2>
            <p>
                Zach wrote over a million words in the time they were alive, many of them on their blog, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200609065639/http://socratic-form-microscopy.com/">Socratic Form Microscopy</a>. In retrospect, it’s kind of ridiculous how many ideas they were generating every week. The website is down right now, so the link goes to archive.org. (I’m working on getting it back up and will update this page once I have.)
            </p>
            <p>
                You can find a few other traces of Zach on the internet, if you’re curious. They wrote around <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/46626554-zachary-jacobi?sort=review&view=reviews">100 reviews</a> and collected some <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/list/46626554">quotes</a> on Goodreads, though the <a href="https://tessa.fyi/socratic-form-microscopy/tag/book-review">Book Review tag</a> on their blog are a much more substantial picture of what they were reading. Zach had taken the <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/">Giving What We Can</a> pledge, and there is an <a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com/Fundraiser.aspx?FundraiserID=8259">Against Malaria Foundation</a> fundraiser in their name.

                This is the best photo I ever took of Zach.
