            I swore an oath upon honor and cold iron before departing <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">Waterloo</a>,
            Ontario to become an engineer at <a href="https://zymergen.com/">Zymergen</a> in Emeryville, California,
            where I spent four years attempting to persuade robots to do biology experiments. I realized I was spending
            an awful lot of my spare time reading papers about biosecurity, so now I'm back in Toronto and working
            remotely for iGEM's <a href="https://igem.org/Safety">Safety and Security Program</a>.
          </p>

            <strong>Professional bio</strong>: Tessa Alexanian is a Safety and Security Program Officer with the iGEM
            Foundation. She used to spend her days wrangling robots to do biological engineering, but now spends more
            time wondering how to get biologists to engineer the right things. At iGEM, her work focuses on creating
            incentives and programs that encourage synthetic biology development that is responsible, responsive, safe
            and secure. Tessa co-founded East Bay Biosecurity Group, insigated the Catalyst collaborative biosecurity
            summit, and was the 2020 Foresight Fellow in Responsible Biotechnology and a 2017 iGEM delegate to the BWC.
