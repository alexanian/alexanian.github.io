            I swore an oath upon honor and cold iron before departing <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">Waterloo</a>,
            Ontario to become an engineer at <a href="https://zymergen.com/">Zymergen</a> in Emeryville, California,
            where I spent four years attempting to persuade robots to do biology experiments. I realized I was spending
            an awful lot of my spare time reading papers about biosecurity, so now I'm working on preventing pandemics
            and generally aiming for nice futures for biotechnology, most recently as part of iGEM's
            <a href="https://responsibility.igem.org">Safety and Security Program</a>.

            <strong>Professional bio</strong>: Tessa Alexanian is trying to steer towards nice futures for
            biotechnology. She's worked on modular lab automation, nucleic acid synthesis screening, assessing dual-use
            risks in synthetic biology projects, bioweapons convention compliance, and creating cultures of
            responsibility. Tessa wrangled robots to do bioengineering for four years at Zymergen, served for two years
            at the iGEM Competition’s Safety and Security officer, and has collaborated with organizations including
            Open Philanthropy, NTI | bio, and RAND. She holds a 2023 Council on Strategic Risks Fellowship for
            Ending Bioweapons, and was a 2022 ELBI fellow, 2020 Foresight Fellow, and 2017 iGEM BWC delegate.

            I also have a <a href="/doc/Tessa_Alexanian_CV_2023.pdf">resumé</a>, if you're into that sort of thing.
